## Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity
### _Homework_
#### _Task 1_
1. What is the expected running time of the following C# code? Explain why.
  - Assume the array's size is `n`.

```cs
long Compute(int[] arr)
{
    long count = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<arr.Length; i++)
    {
        int start = 0, end = arr.Length-1;
        while (start < end)
            if (arr[start] < arr[end])
                { start++; count++; }
            else 
                end--;
    }
    return count;
}
```
#### _Answer_
The algorithm complexity is `O(n*n)`. 
#### _Explanation_
The first `for` loop is traversed `n`(arr.Length) times and for each of these loops the inner `while` loop is traversed another `n` times.

#### _Task 2_
2. What is the expected running time of the following C# code?
  - Explain why.
  - Assume the input matrix has size of n * m.

```cs
long CalcCount(int[,] matrix)
{
    long count = 0;
    for (int row=0; row<matrix.GetLength(0); row++)
        if (matrix[row, 0] % 2 == 0)
            for (int col=0; col<matrix.GetLength(1); col++)
                if (matrix[row,col] > 0)
                    count++;
    return count;
}
```
#### _Answer_
The algorithm complexity is `O(n*m)`. 
#### _Explanation_
The first `for` loop will be executed `n` times.The inner `for` loop will be executed only if a number from the first row of the matrix is even. The second `for` loop will execute `m` times but for certain conditions. There are different formulas if the numbers from the row are all even, half even or almost no even(best, average, worst case scenarios) but the actual count of even numbers doesn't matter because this will  be a constant to the equation. Therefore the algorithm complexity is `n*m`.
#### _Task 3_
3. * What is the expected running time of the following C# code?
  - Explain why.
  - Assume the input matrix has size of n * m.

```cs
long CalcSum(int[,] matrix, int row)
{
    long sum = 0;
    for (int col = 0; col < matrix.GetLength(0); col++) 
        sum += matrix[row, col];
    if (row + 1 < matrix.GetLength(1)) 
        sum += CalcSum(matrix, row + 1);
    return sum;
}

Console.WriteLine(CalcSum(matrix, 0));
```
#### _Answer_
The algorithm complexity is `O(n*m)`. 
#### _Explanation_
The first `for` loop will be executed `n`(number of columns) times. For each loop the `if` will execute `m-1`(`m` - number of rows) times recursively. The equation is `n*(m-1)`. Since the constant is not relevant to the algorithm complexity formula the final equation is `O(n*m)`.
